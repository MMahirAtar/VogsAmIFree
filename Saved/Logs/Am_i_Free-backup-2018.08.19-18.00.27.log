Please make sure to enable the 'Export Smoothing Groups' option in the FBX Exporter plug-in before exporting the file.  Even for tools that don't support smoothing groups, the FBX Exporter will generate appropriate smoothing data at export-time so that correct vertex normals can be inferred while importing.

This can happen for bones that are not vert weighted. If they are not in the correct orientation after importing,
please set the "Use T0 as ref pose" option or add them to the bind pose and reimport the skeletal mesh.
